First of all it is necessary that you already have

* tensorflowjs model in the ```/web/src/web_model``` directory
* nodejs & npm installed

## Usage

Ensure that you are in the ```/web``` directory then run

```
npm install
```

Once the dependencies are installed run

```
npm run build
```

Then you will notice that ```bundle.js``` is created in ```/src``` directory.

Now serve the ```/src``` directory on a local server.
