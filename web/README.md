# For Web Serving

## [See it working!](https://nxt-word.firebaseapp.com)

First of all it is necessary that you already have :

* tensorflowjs model in the `/web/dist/web_model` directory
* nodejs & npm installed

## Usage

Ensure that you are in the `/web` directory then run :

```powershell
npm install
```

Once the dependencies are installed run :

```powershell
npm run build
```

Then you will notice that `main.bundle.js` and other chunk files are built in `/dist` directory.

To serve the `/dist` directory to a localhost run :

```powershell
npm run serve
```
